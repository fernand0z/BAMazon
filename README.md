# :package: BAMazon :computer:

### Overview

BAMazon is a digital storefront CLI app using Node.js and MySQL.  

### Customer Module

The Customer Module application is contained in the `bamazonCustomer.js`  file.

This application interacts with a MySQL database to display available merchandise to the customer, and updates inventory based on submitted orders.

### MySQL Database


### Node Pacakges (npm)

To run the modules in your CLI terminal application, use the Node Package Manager to install the npm dependences.  Prior to running the application's .js file, enter the following into your CLI terminal program:
`npm install`

or you may manually install each of the packages

`npm i mysql` <br>

`npm i inquierer`

`npm i console.table`

`npm i chalk`

### Application Demo

Below is a demo of the application's functionality, including screenshots of various outcomes from user input.  

The user must first download/clone the repo *and* install the npm dependencies.  The user must also have access to the bamazon database and it's products table in MySQL.  For testing, you may open the `bamazon.sql` script file in MySQL.  Executing the script file will create the database for interaction with the application.  Please note: the `bamazonCustomer.js` file specifies a username of 'root' and password of 'root'.  Update these values in the .js file if necessary.

In your CLI, run following code to begin: 

`node bamazonCustomer.js`

A table of available merchandise will be displayed with the following columns `ID`, `PRODUCT_NAME`, `DEPARTMENT`, and `PRICE_$`.  The customer will be prompted to select an item to purchase by entering its `ID`.

Once an item ID and order quantity are submitted, the application will query MySQL database for the item's inventory quantity.  A conditional statement then confirms that sufficient inventory is available to fulfill the order.  

A confirmation of the order quantity and the item's relevant information is redisplayed to the customer.  The order quantity is then multipled by the item's `PRICE_$`, and the calculated order total is shown to the user.  

The `STOCK_QTY` field of the databse for the ordered item is also depleted by the order quantity.

In the case that the order quantity exceeds the `STOCK_QTY` value, the customer is displayed an error message and prompted to revise the order quantity to a number equal to or less than the current `STOCK_QTY` and the prompt will then re-validate the quantity against the database.
